# Air-Passengers-Forecasting-using-Time-Series-Analytics
The Air Passenger Data Forecasting Project employs time series analytics to analyze historical data on air passenger numbers and forecast future trends. Focusing on creating an accurate predictive model for the next 12 months, the project encompasses crucial steps such as optimal forecasting techniques, exploratory data analysis, model selection, and evaluation. By utilizing regression models, ARIMA, and advanced exponential smoothing (Holt-Winters Model), the project aims to provide airlines with a robust tool for planning and optimizing operations. The comprehensive analysis considers not only historical data patterns but also factors in trends, seasonality, and other components to enhance the accuracy of the predictive models.

Accurate air passenger traffic forecasting is vital for the aviation industry, aiding airlines, airports, and government agencies in making informed decisions. The project extends its focus to forecasting USA export data, aiming to predict upcoming quarters of 2023 and the fiscal year. Through meticulous data preprocessing, model partitioning, and performance evaluation, the project ensures the reliability of its predictive models. The findings and implications extend beyond mere numerical predictions, emphasizing the broader impact on infrastructure planning, safety measures, and environmental sustainability within the aviation sector.

In conclusion, the project's meticulous approach to time series analysis and forecasting models, particularly highlighting the effectiveness of the automated Holt-Winters Model, demonstrates its significance for the aviation industry. The lower RMSE and MAPE values achieved by this model, compared to other regression models and ARIMA, underscore its superiority in providing accurate predictions. The project's insights offer valuable guidance for airlines to optimize scheduling, pricing, and capacity planning, ultimately contributing to increased efficiency and profitability over the next 12 months.
